> **The AI Sidebar Copilot for Microsoft Word**

WordPilot is a next-generation AI-powered writing assistant that seamlessly integrates into Microsoft Word. It delivers real-time document editing, contextual intelligence, and comprehensive control over Word's capabilities—providing professional, human-like writing assistance that significantly surpasses Microsoft's limited Copilot offering.

**Think of it as Cursor IDE meets MS Word** – an intelligent agent that *thinks*, *plans*, and *writes* like a human, while fully understanding all of Word's advanced formatting and layout tools.

## 🚀 Vision

Microsoft Copilot is expensive, restricted to enterprise plans, and lacks the depth and flexibility modern users need. **WordPilot** changes that by:

- Understanding formatting, document structure, and writing standards—not just generating text
- Integrating directly into Word's UI with a **sidebar interface** inspired by **Cursor IDE**
- Operating in **three powerful modes**: `Ask`, `Write`, and `Agent`

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🧠 Sidebar Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Ask** | Chat-style interface to get help, ask questions, or clarify writing concepts |
| **Write** | Generates content based on prompts and inserts it directly into the document |
| **Agent** | Full intelligent mode that understands prompts, plans content, formats output, and writes in real-time |

### 🛠 Real-Time, In-Document Writing

When you prompt: **"Write about India in 100 words."**

WordPilot will:
1. Display a thoughtful response in the chat:
   - _"Thinking..."_
   - _"Planning structure..."_
   - _"Inserting content now..."_
   
2. Begin typing in your Word document:
   - With correct paragraph formatting
   - Maintaining font consistency
   - Showing progress as it writes section by section

### 🧾 Full Word Feature Control

Unlike basic AI writing tools, **WordPilot** intelligently uses all major Word features:

- **Text Styling:** Bold, Italics, Underline, Headings, Lists
- **Document Layouts:** Section breaks, Columns, Indents, Margins
- **Advanced Elements:**
  - ✅ Tables
  - ✅ Equations
  - ✅ Symbols
  - ✅ WordArt & SmartArt
