## Overview

**WordPilot** is a next-generation AI-powered writing assistant seamlessly integrated into Microsoft Word. Inspired by Cursor IDE, it delivers real-time, context-aware document editing, intelligent content generation, and full control over Word’s features—outperforming Microsoft’s Copilot with affordability and flexibility for all users.

## Project Goals

- Build a **context-aware AI** that reads entire documents (e.g., 70+ pages), tracks cursor position, and adapts to user intent.
- Provide a **sidebar-based UI** with three modes: `Ask`, `Write`, and `Agent`.
- Enable **full Word feature control** (text, tables, citations, SmartArt) with professional formatting.
- Scale to **100K+ users** with a freemium model and Microsoft AppSource launch.

## Key Features

### Sidebar Modes
- **Ask**: Chat-style help for writing questions.
- **Write**: Generates and inserts content with proper formatting.
- **Agent**: Plans, writes, and formats autonomously, showing real-time progress (e.g., “Thinking…”, “Typing…”).

### Context-Aware Intelligence
- Reads full documents to understand structure and content.
- Tracks cursor position for contextual suggestions and insertions.
- Adapts to user intent (e.g., academic, business, creative) with tailored tone and formatting.

### Full Word Feature Control
- **Text Styling**: Bold, italics, headings, lists.
- **Layouts**: Columns, section breaks, margins.
- **Advanced Elements**: Tables, equations, SmartArt, citations, footnotes.

### Example Use Cases
- **Academic**: Formats IEEE abstracts with citations.
- **Business**: Drafts memos with headers and bullet points.
- **Students**: Inserts styled tables for comparisons.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for sidebar UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express for LLM calls and real-time updates.
- **AI**: GPT-4-turbo for content generation and context analysis.
- **Integration**: Office.js for document manipulation and cursor tracking.
- **Scalability**: AWS ECS, Redis, Cloudflare CDN.
